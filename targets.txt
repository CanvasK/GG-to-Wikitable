# Add event URLs or slugs below. Each event should get its own line.
# To assign configs per event, place a semicolon (;) after the URL/slug and use the names from config.cfg and an equals (=) between the name and value, separating each setting with a comma (,).
# Not every config needs to be added. Defaults to the values in config.cfg if it is not added.
